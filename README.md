### Why?

Honestly, just a toy project to get more acquainted with the
honorable rust language, slayer of CPPuses

### So what does it do?

This piece  of code you can freely access to burn your retinas, dear user,
just like an ecclipse, is a braifuck interpreter. I tried not to use any
dependencies that would hinder learning something interesting, and so i implemented
the lexer and parser myself, which is probably a very bad idea for anything
serious given my knowledge level. But you would need to be a special kinda
of nutjob to use brainfuck for anything serious.

### How to compile?
Seriously? Well, you could try

```cargo build --release```

as a starter.


### What?
This project was not programmed with the intention of being mantained. After
i finish it i will probably be done, use it at your own risk.
